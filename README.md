# Image Clustering Project

This project uses K-Means and DBSCAN to cluster pixel data from images.

## Files
- `algorithms.py`: Contains the custom implementations of the clustering algorithms.
- `image_clustering.ipynb`: The notebook to run the experiments.
- `giraffe.png`: The source image.

## How to run
1. Open the notebook.
2. Ensure all files are in the same directory.
3. Run the cells to see the segmentation results.
